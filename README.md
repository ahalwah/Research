# Pose Detection-based Framework for Human Motion Capture for Mechanism Synthesis, Motion Generation, and Visualization
## Installation Instructions
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed. If you do not have Node.js installed, you can download it [here] (https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Clone or download the respository onto your machine. If you download the zip folder make sure to extract all of its components into a new folder.
3. Open a terminal and change directory to the root folder directory of the repository. Change directories until you are inside the *program* folder.

5. Once the insatallation is complete, you can start the application using the command *npm start*. Step 4 is done only once after download.

## Application Overview
This application was developed using React.js and P5.js to capture human movement using a webcam for visualization and extraction of task positions for mechanism synthesis problems.
